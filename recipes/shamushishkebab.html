    <h5>Delicious kebabs made out of grilled, beloved whale</h5>
    <p>We all love Shamu. Shamu, the whale from Seaworld that does tricks? Turns out 
        Seaworld is more insidious than previously thought. Recently they opened up a new onsite
        restaurant, "Shamu's Grill Shack". Patrons of the restaurant raved about the uniquely seasoned
        and flavored meat that was sold there. An undercover investigative journalist broke news 
        that their cheap and savory shish kebabs were actually made out of their beloved whale performer, Shamu!
        Amidst public outcry, a recipe for these kebabs was discreetly released for those that were curious. Here it is below.
